Horticulture is important for several reasons, spanning environmental, economic, and social dimensions:

1. Food Security: Horticulture involves the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and other crops, contributing significantly to food supply and nutritional diversity. It ensures the availability of fresh produce rich in vitamins and minerals.


2. Economic Growth: It provides employment opportunities, especially in rural areas. It supports industries like food processing, floriculture, and landscaping, contributing to national and global economies.


3. Environmental Benefits: Horticultural practices help in biodiversity conservation, soil health improvement, and water conservation. Urban horticulture (e.g., gardens, parks) improves air quality and reduces urban heat island effects.


4. Aesthetic and Recreational Value: Ornamental horticulture enhances the beauty of landscapes, parks, and urban spaces, improving the quality of life and promoting mental well-being. Gardens and parks provide spaces for recreation and relaxation.

5. Sustainability and Climate Resilience: Sustainable horticultural practices can mitigate climate change effects by promoting carbon sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing resilience to extreme weather conditions. Research and Innovation: Horticulture is a field that fosters scientific research, leading to innovations in plant breeding, pest control, and sustainable agriculture, which helps in adapting to changing global conditions.
